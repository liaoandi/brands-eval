YOUR GUIDE TO THE STORY
  BEHIND THE BARCODE




 Ethical
Fashion
 Guide
        April 2016
What is the Ethical Fashion Guide?
This guide is a companion to the 2016 Australian Fashion
report and seeks to empower you to purchase from
companies that treat their workers ethically. By doing
so, you encourage more companies and decision makers
to take action to ensure workers are not exploited, they
are paid adequately and they work free from the tyranny
of modern slavery. You can view the full 2016 Australian
Fashion Report at www.behindthebarcode.org.au

Company Ratings
This guide grades 87 companies and 308 brands and
provides an overall grade of each brand’s labour rights
management systems. Higher grades correspond to
systems which, when implemented well, should reduce
the risk of modern slavery, child labour and exploitation.
This information is derived from research undertaken by
Baptist World Aid Australia’s project, Behind the Barcode.

How was the research conducted?
40 separate criteria were used to analyse each company’s
policies, knowledge of their supply chain, supplier
relationships, monitoring practices and level of worker
empowerment. Companies were graded based on the
evidence and input they supplied in response to these
criteria and pertinent publicly available information.

How to use it?
We hope that you take this little guide with you whenever
you shop, to empower you to make every day ethical
purchasing decisions.
Does shopping ‘ethically’ make much
of a difference?

decisions can make! Since the first edition of the Ethical
Fashion Guide in 2013…

A living wage is recognised as a human right, yet the
reality for the vast majority of garment sector workers
is that wages are set so low that the workers and their
families remain trapped in a cycle of poverty.
A living wage is a wage that is sufficient for workers to
be able to afford the basics (food, water, shelter, clothing,
power, healthcare and education) for themselves and
their dependants, while having a little left over for
emergency savings or discretionary spending.
The following brands were able to demonstrate that they
were paying improved wages to workers in a portion of
their supply chain:

Who We are
Baptist World Aid Australia is an international aid and
development organisation, with a vision to see a world
where poverty has ended, where all people enjoy the
fullness of life God intends. Established in 1959, the
organisation works in 18 countries in Asia, Africa and the
Pacific across four key areas; child-centred community
development, community development, disaster
management and advocacy. Baptist World Aid has been
involved in campaigning various industries to end worker
exploitation for over 8 years and began research into the
Fashion and Electronics industries in 2010.
