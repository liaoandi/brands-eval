                 The Clean Clothes Campaign
                 An international alliance that works to improve conditions and support the
                 empowerment of workers in the global garment industry. The Clean Clothes Campaign
                 has national campaigns in 16 European countries, with a network of 250 organisations
                 worldwide and an international secretariat based in Amsterdam. cleanclothes.org


                 The Asia Floor Wage Alliance
                 An international alliance of trade unions and labour-rights activists who are working
                 together to demand garment workers in Asia are paid a living wage. Led by trade unions
                 in key garment-producing countries in the region, the Asia Floor Wage Alliance represents
                 the concerns and needs of the workers themselves. In 2011, the alliance first published
                 a calculation of a living wage for Asia, the Asia Floor Wage. The members of this alliance
                 are now using the Asia Floor Wage figure as a tool to negotiate with companies and
                 governments towards payment of a living wage. asiafloorwage.org

                            Company position on the living wage:
                            “The Adidas Group has examined the question of fair wages and has concluded that the
                            best way to improve the general welfare of workers is to work with our business partners
                            at the enterprise level to promote wage-setting mechanisms which are transparent and
                            have been developed with the direct input of workers...”

                            “Although we value the work that has been done by the labour NGOs to develop the
                            Asian Floor Wage, and acknowledge that it is a useful reference wage, with broad
                            support from civil society and international trade unions, we do not require our suppliers
                            to follow a proscribed living wage methodology when considering the cost of living for
                            workers. We are continuing to explore this subject through our engagement with the Fair
                            Wage Network.”



                            What we say:
                            Adidas is engaging in work to assess its wage practices across Asia, but as a company
                            it is still not willing to define what a living wage means in its business. By failing to do
                            this, and passing on responsibility for wages in supplier factories to factory owners,
                            the significant change needed for workers will never happen. Adidas must engage in
                            identifying a living-wage figure and changing pricing in order to enable its payment.

                             are encouraged to provide wages and benefits that are sufficient to meet workers’ basic

                             Company position on the living wage:
                             “ASICS recognizes the issues around fair wages in our industry as well as the need for a
                             clear fair wage mechanism going beyond a strict living wages scope. ASICS does not yet
                             have a company definition of living wage in particular as we believe a broader approach to
                             wages is advisable...

                             “As a group, however, we would, rather than pursuing only one of the current definitions of a
                             living wage, like to see a clear consensus around fair wages which include a wider range of
                             worker rights and labor practices which could include what one might call a living wage. ILO
                             [International Labour Organization] conventions and definitions regarding fair wages form an
                             important starting point of our company on this subject...

                             “For 2014 the subject of fair wages is a priority subject within the ASICS Groups approach to
                             Corporate Responsibility.”



                             What we say:
                             Asics accepts the principle of a living wage, but in practice applies the legal minimum
                             wage or industry benchmark. Good intentions are two a penny, actual commitment is
                             needed. As for a “broader approach to wages”, what is more important than the fact
                             that a wage should be enough to live on? This is surely the starting point.

                                What we say:
                                C&A is doing very little to ensure that a living wage is paid to workers in its supply chains.
                                It does not accept that there is a definition of a living wage (although it is fairly clear to
                                us), and as such has failed to embed this in its company practice – disappointing.

                                Company position on the living wage:
                                “Our company doesn’t own any factory; hence we don’t pay workers wages in the
                                factories which supply us. Carrefour’s role is to ensure the worker’s salary is paid as per
                                the law of the country in the factories where we buy products and that the salary paid
                                also includes overtime and bank holidays premium and required benefits as defined in
                                the law. This is a minimum and unavoidable requirement.”

                                “We can find many different definitions of a living wage from different organization and
                                will leave the debate in their hands. Although it is a very important debate, we, as a
                                retailer company have no legitimacy in defining it and haven’t set up any calculation
                                formula. As far as we are concerned our definition is written in our charter: Wages and
                                compensation for regular working hours shall meet basic needs and provide some
                                discretionary income for workers and their families.”



                                What we say:
                                Global brands such as Carrefour cannot wash their hands of the responsibility to work
                                out how to pay a living wage, while acknowledging the fact that a wage should meet
                                basic needs. Carrefour has chosen to engage in global trade, and so has chosen to take
                                on the responsibility that comes with it. Saying it doesn’t directly employ the workers
                                who make its clothes is not a responsible answer when the company’s activity clearly
                                has an impact on the lives of thousands of workers making its products.

                             Company position on the living wage:
                             “We implement the BSCI [Business Social Compliance Initiative] Code of Conduct in our
                             international supply chain. This Code prescribes the payment of the legal minimum wage.
                             This legal minimum wage should be at a level that covers workers basic needs as well

                             BSCI work towards the payment of a living wage.”

                             “We believe it is essential to emphasize the importance of a holistic approach towards
                             the issue of fair remuneration for workers. In this context, it is important to address the
                             qualitative aspects of wages as well as quantitative aspects ... such as the way of payment,
                             timely and formal payment of wages, reflecting skills and education of workers in the level
                             of wages, and equal treatment of full-time employees, part-time, and piece-rates workers.”



                             What we say:
                             Charles Vögele has simply repeated back to us the answers provided by the BSCI,
                             without engaging in the issues. It has chosen to hide behind the BSCI and outsource

                             improving the wage situation in its supply chain and increasing pay to a living-wage level.

                             Charles Vögele referred us to the BSCI Code of Conduct, which includes statements
                             on freedom of association. This code is displayed in its supplier factories.

                             Charles Vögele says: “Due information and training of factory workers [about freedom of
                             association and the right to collective bargaining] is the responsibility of factory management,
                             the honouring of which is a requirement for BSCI Code of Conduct compliance.”

Has living-wage benchmarks?
No.

Worker empowerment:
Gucci says: “The Right to Freedom of Association and Collective Bargaining is clearly
communicated through our supply chain ... We training periodically (at least yearly) all
of our direct suppliers on our Social Responsibility Policy. This kind of activity has been
shared with the main Unions on the basis of an agreement signed in 2004.”

Commitment and practices:
Gucci uses the Italian minimum wage as a living-wage benchmark. It says that this is a
suitable figure because it was established by national collective agreements.

Collaborative approach:
Gucci signed agreements in 2004, 2009 and 2012 with the Italian trade union
confederations CGIL, CISL and UIL.

Gucci has had proactive and productive dialogue with the Italian branch of the
Clean Clothes Campaign regarding a number of issues, including sandblasting.

Strategy:
None.

Production overview:
Number of suppliers: 400 first-tier suppliers, 3,600 subcontracted suppliers
Main production countries listed as: Italy (100%)
Gucci does not publish a full public list of the names and addresses of its supplier
factories, but this list is shared confidentially with unions.



Comments:
Gucci says its production is entirely based in Italy, where rights are upheld. However, we
would not consider Italy to be a ‘low risk’ country in terms of rights. Indeed, in December
2013, a fire in a subcontractor’s factory in the town of Prato killed seven Chinese migrant
workers, and unions said the health and safety problems that caused the disaster were
common in the area. Due to a significant use of the informal sector and migrant labour in
Italy, Gucci’s production needs to be carefully monitored if the company is to be sure that
wages are enough to meet workers’ basic needs and ensure their rights.

We have questions about the fact that there is such a high volume of subcontracted
work in Gucci’s supply chain, and suspect that some of these subcontractors may be
outside Italy. No information was given about how this subcontracting is monitored or
how workers’ rights are upheld in these factories. It is crucial that Gucci engages in its
subcontracting policy and takes responsibility for rights in these factories also.

                             out in support of a ‘fair living wage’. However, its strategy lacks a living wage benchmark.
                             The wage increases that are currently possible at a factory level through negotiation,
                             when the starting point is only a fraction of the amount needed, will not reach an

Comments:
We are disappointed that H&M’s newly announced Roadmap to a Fair Living Wage fails
to clearly state a living-wage benchmark. Although there are many good elements to
what H&M has developed, without such a definition it is impossible to create a ‘road
map’ to achieving the payment of such a wage or measure the road map’s success.

A key part of H&M’s strategy is promoting negotiations at a factory level, based on
wage levels proposed by workers. We obviously support the need for wages to be
negotiated – this is key. However, factory-level negotiations alone will not achieve ‘fair
living wages’. The wage increases that are possible at factory level, when the starting
position is a minimum wage that is only a quarter or a sixth of a living wage, will never
reach an actual living wage sufficient to feed and support a family. A commitment must
come from H&M to raise the wage significantly via a benchmark. Such a commitment
may open the space in negotiations for trade unions to make wage demands that
represent the real needs of workers.

H&M’s statement that, in order to achieve a fair living wage, it is willing to pay more
to its suppliers marks a commitment that is essential at the heart of any wage
improvement. This is welcome. It is also encouraging that H&M is committed to
improving its purchasing practices to decrease overtime.

H&M says that as part of the worker assessments of perceived living wage, which
will be carried out to calculate wage levels in its new model factories, the following
parameters will be assessed: “Food, Accommodation, Health, Education, Clothing
and Vacation/leisure.” We are concerned that this limited list – which omits family care,
transport and discretionary income – will give an inaccurate picture of what a real living
wage is. The fact that some workers have to support elderly relatives and children must
play a central role in the calculation (a living wage may be three times the amount that
an individual needs to survive).

On top of the factory-level negotiations, H&M must go further in ensuring the
inclusion of local unions, whose role is critical. Signing the Indonesia Protocol would be
a good step and a learning experience. This agreement, already signed by a number
of major sportswear brands in Indonesia, is delivering some very concrete actions
to enable better workplace representation across many suppliers, and is proving a
groundbreaking test bed for how to ensure freedom of association in the industry. H&M
could also consider broadening its advisory board to ensure local trade unions have
more direct representation.

H&M’s statement that it plans to scale up a project to create Worker Participation
Committees in 100% of its key supplier factories is a bit worrying. Although helpful
for improving factory-level communication at times, these committees can act as a
parallel means to worker empowerment and, in fact, prohibit the engagement of local
unions in factory processes. Worker committees should only be used in places where
trade union rights are prohibited, otherwise local unions engage in these processes via
access agreements and issuance of the ‘right to organise’ guarantee. We hope that
H&M will take this important point on board.

We are keen to follow H&M’s progress as it moves forward with its commitment to
a ‘fair living wage’.

                                Company position on the living wage:
                                “Our supplier contracts are based on the norms of the International Labour Organization
                                (ILO). They contain requirements that all employees are covered at least by the legal
                                minimum wage, the legally defined minimum leave and the defined maximum working
                                hours. If there is no, or no adequate, legislation in the country concerned, our HUGO
                                BOSS Social Standards set the standard to ensure appropriate working conditions for
                                the employees.

                                “Safety at work, the prohibition of child labor and the payment of fair wages are just a few
                                of the mandates that we set for our producers. However, far from relying exclusively on
                                legal covenants, we actively monitor compliance with our social and ecological guidelines
                                during regular visits to the sites, together with an external consultancy.”



                                What we say:
                                Hugo Boss has basic information on minimum-wage payment within its code of
                                conduct and a section on sustainability in its 2012 annual report. Other than this,
                                there is no evidence of any work being done within supply chains to ensure workers
                                are being paid a living wage. All in all very disappointing for such a high-profile brand.

                             international supply chain. This Code prescribes the payment of the legal minimum wage.

                             “We believe it is essential to emphasize the importance of a holistic approach towards
                             the issue of fair remuneration for workers. In this context, it is important to address
                             the qualitative aspects of wages as well as quantitative aspects ... such as the way of
                             payment, timely and formal payment of wages, reflecting skills and education of workers
                             in the level of wages, and equal treatment of full-time employees, part-time, and piece-
                             rates workers.”



                             What we say:
                             As with Lidl, Aldi, WE and others, IC Companys has simply repeated back to us the

                             living-wage level.

                             International Framework Agreement, is commendable. While the focus on freedom of
                             association is very welcome, the focus on delivering improvements to wages needs to
                             be improved and developed if workers in the company’s supplier factories are to start
                             seeing concrete improvements to their economic well-being.

                             Inditex cited benchmarks in some countries, including Morocco, Spain and Portugal.
                             For Asia, no benchmarks have been established.

Comments:
Inditex continues to merge its responsibility to ensure workers are paid a living
wage with its commitment to freedom of association. While we certainly agree that
collective bargaining between management and trade unions is a fundamental part
of improving and maintaining wages, this approach relies on strong trade unions
within all workplaces and countries. This is simply not the case in many of the
regions where garment production takes place. The long-term strategy of supporting
trade unions needs to be supplemented by work to increase wages urgently in the
short term.

Inditex states that any collective agreement freely negotiated between employers
and elected trade union representatives counts as a fair wage. We both agree
and disagree with this statement. Certainly any negotiated agreement on wage
must be respected. But even where trade unions do exist, they often do not have
the political space to demand real living wages at the factory level or in national
minimum-wage negotiations, especially when the starting point is a minimum wage
that is only a quarter of the amount needed. The downward price pressure exerted
by international buyers denies the space for workers to negotiate a real living wage
based on actual need.

This is why it is essential that Inditex develops benchmarks based on the real cost of
living for workers and ensures these are included in the prices paid to factories. We
hope that work with the ILO on “proper calculation of Living wages in different sourcing
countries” will play a part in Inditex making this important step.

Developing benchmarks does not and should not undermine the work of a trade
union. In fact, knowing that key buyers have a commitment to moving toward a
living-wage figure may actually assist trade unions in making wage demands that
represent the real needs of workers, and open up space in negotiations.

We were shocked to see that the living-wage benchmarks that Inditex did provide
(for Europe and Morocco only) were so low – just above the minimum wage.

Inditex also lacks a strategy to address the problem of poverty wages where trade
unions are not yet well established. It would be more than possible for Inditex to look
at improving wages in the short term, alongside its programme of trade union rights.
This would require a clear, time-bound strategy for reaching a living-wage level in its
key supplier factories in major production countries.

Inditex is able to demonstrate efforts to address other related issues, such as
homeworking and short-term contracts, and has proved willing to collaborate with
key stakeholders to deliver pilot projects, which is great. Unfortunately, to date,
Inditex has been reluctant to engage with the Asia Floor Wage proposal. This is
disappointing. Given its commitment to engagement and the buying power Inditex
has in key Asia Floor Wage countries, the company would be a good candidate for
working with the trade unions involved and testing the implementation of the Asia
Floor Wage benchmark.

Comments:
LS & Co. is doing very little to directly combat wage issues in its supply chain, which
is disappointing. The limited work the company is promoting with suppliers, aiming to
improve “worker well-being”, is based on a ‘return on investment’ approach and looks
mostly for results in terms of productivity increases. This can be a good incentive for
supplier involvement in such programmes but current work does not seem to have
direct impact on worker wages. No concrete figures showing if wages are being
improved by this initiative are documented.

The focus of LS & Co.’s new well-being strategy seems to miss the point. Companies
are welcome to undertake charitable work in countries where they source their
goods, but this does not remove the responsibility they have to ensure that core
human rights are upheld. It seems that effort is being poured into health provision,
maths classes and free meals, which workers do need – but work is needed first to
address freedom of association and the right to a living wage.

Many of the programmes listed in this profile were developed and funded through the
Levi Strauss Foundation, which the company says leads “pioneer” work for LS & Co.
It seems to us that this foundation, in return, avoids raising questions about the core
business practice of the company by separating off ethical practice from business
decisions. We do not see corporate social responsibility as the work of charitable
foundations, but rather as something that should be ingrained in a business model.
There was little evidence found of work to address purchasing practices.

LS & Co., despite supporting the concept of a living wage, is unable to demonstrate
any work to define or deliver this figure, it seems. The company says that because
there is a lack of an internationally recognised benchmark or consensus between
brands, it is not possible to move forward. To this, we say that the debate has moved
on. The Asia Floor Wage set a figure defining what a living wage means in terms
of purchasing power in 2009, and since then a number of nuanced systems have
emerged that allow companies to compare the wages paid to their suppliers against
a ladder of benchmarks and thus measure progress. This excuse for not engaging
in proactive work to assess a living wage and move towards its payment is no longer
valid. We hope that LS & Co. can take this on board and start monitoring progress
against real benchmarking.

We would like to see more evidence of LS & Co. taking responsibility for its own
business practices, including pricing, taking practical steps to support freedom of
association in its supplier factories and working with others to design and implement
programmes that aim to deliver real, measurable changes for workers producing Levi
Strauss goods.

                                Company position on the living wage:
                                “The aim of paying ‘living wages’ is clearly stated in our Code of Conduct, which is a
                                fixed part of all contracts with business partners.

                                “In accordance with its cooperation in ILO’s [the International Labour Organization’s] Fair
                                Wage Network, BSCI stresses the importance of including qualitative aspects such as
                                the way of payment, timely and formal payment of wages, reflecting skills and education
                                of workers in the level of wages, and equal treatment of full-time employees, part-time,
                                and piece-rates workers. Thus, it is important to address the quantitative aspects of
                                wages as well as qualitative aspects. Focusing on the quantitative level of the wage
                                earned by workers alone is not enough.”



                                What we say:
                                This might all sound familiar if you’ve read the statements of many other BSCI members
                                in this report. Like a number of these companies, Lidl has mostly repeated the answers
                                given to it by the BSCI. However, some further information provided by the company
                                highlights interesting project work in Bangladesh, on top of business-as-usual BSCI

                             pays are enough to ensure the basic needs of its workers are met. The company’s ‘Plan
                             A’ commitment to pay a living wage is commendable. M&S has yet to disclose the figures
                             it is using to benchmark a living wage and much of its model relies heavily on purchasing
                             practices – without real data we remain unsure about the real progress being made.



                             In more detail:
                             Has living-wage benchmarks?
                             Yes, but refuses to disclose these.

                            Company position on the living wage:
                            Mango says: (in its code of conduct) “Manufacturers will guarantee that salaries comply
                            strictly with all legislation. Equally the minimum legal wage will be considered the legal
                            minimum, but not a recommended wage level.”

                            It also told us that “most of our suppliers have their own remuneration policies that follow
                            the minimum wage … but that they also give allowances for accommodation, food, skill
                            productivity etc. We support and push these kinds of policies.”



                            What we say:
                            Mango has yet to make any commitments at all to ensure workers in its supplier factories
                            receive a living wage, even in its own code of conduct, although it claims it does
                            agree with our definition of a living wage. A living wage must be paid as a basic salary,
                            excluding any extra, discretionary bonuses, as it is only the basic wage that workers
                            can be sure of receiving. Simply “encouraging” suppliers will not be sufficient to ensure
                            wages are improved to a living-wage level.

                                that it has no engagement with ethical trading at all.

                             [Fair Labor Association] Code of Conduct. The FLA Code states that ‘every worker has
                             a right to compensation for a regular work week that is sufficient to meet the worker’s

                             What we say:
                             New Balance (NB) is doing very little to ensure that a living wage is paid to workers in its
                             supply chain. Without any definition of what a living wage is, or projects to work towards
                             this, its commitment to making sure a wage meets workers’ basic needs remains a paper
                             promise.

                             New Balance says that suppliers must respect freedom of association (FOA) because it
                             is part of supplier agreements. It adds: “In Indonesia, we have taken additional measures
                             on Freedom of Association by signing the national-level FOA Protocol and also requiring
                             our footwear suppliers to sign and implement the FOA Protocol.”

Commitment and practices:
On pricing, New Balance says: “Footwear costing policy includes a specific
calculation for labor rates.”

Collaborative approach:
New Balance has been working with other buyers on social insurance payment in
Chinese suppliers: “NB has taken a strict position on social insurance, particularly
in China where underpayment of social insurance is common ... In cases where
footwear and apparel factories are shared with other brands, NB has sought to enlist
the help of other brands to help ensure that social insurance benefits are paid.”

Strategy:
New Balance says: “NB recognizes the importance of progressive realization of the
wage standard in the FLA Code of Conduct. To this end, NB plans to join the Fair
Wage project through the FLA in 2014 to encourage evidence-based research on the
implementation of each of the Fair Wage elements in a diverse group of suppliers.”

Production overview:
Number of suppliers: Approximately 200 first-tier suppliers
Main production countries listed as: US, China, Vietnam, Indonesia
New Balance publishes a full public list of the names and addresses of its
supplier factories.



Comments:
New Balance has recently adopted wording from the FLA about wages being enough
to meet basic needs. We hope that this will now become ingrained in the company’s
practice as it starts to work out how to ensure a living wage is being paid to the
people making its products. Currently, work towards this goal is fairly non-existent.

Plans to work with the Fair Wage Network will help. We hope that this new work will
focus primarily on the most important dimension of putting wages up to a living-wage
level, rather than the distraction of other wage payment concerns.

It is good that New Balance is already detailing a specific labour rate as part of
its product cost. We assume that this rate is currently the minimum wage. As
New Balance’s work towards making sure a wage meets workers’ basic needs
progresses, this practice will form a good basis for ensuring costs are enough to
meet living-wage levels too.

It is also good that New Balance has signed the Indonesia Protocol. If it can use
the learnings from this in other parts of its supply chain, in collaboration with other
buyers, this would help to move forward its work in this area.

We hope to see New Balance progress over the next year. It is at the very
start of the road.

Comments:
New Look has been engaging in the Benefits for Business and Workers project (in
partnership with the consultancy Impactt, and other brands), which aims to build
factory capacity and improve communication and problem-solving in factories. One
of the outputs of the BBW project is that wages have gone up through productivity
improvements, but as we have always held about productivity gains, the improvement
to wages has been minimal. The 7% wage increase achieved in Bangladesh by
efficiency improvements is an increase, but given that the minimum wage was
recently put up by 80% (after the project ended) and this still isn’t anywhere near a
living-wage figure, we aren’t keen to call this a living-wage project. However, even if
the project doesn’t achieve a living wage, New Look and Impactt are keen to say that
the ‘transformational change’ and ‘worker empowerment’ aspects are worthwhile.
We aren’t so sure.

Our second concern with the project is that the entire worker-empowerment
emphasis has failed to engage with the trade union movement, and there is
no reference to freedom of association or trade unions in the training materials
provided. The programme has focused on “building towards the idea of Freedom
of Association” by trying to overcome obstructionist attitudes to collective-worker
representation in management. This has involved training programmes and getting
management to engage with legally required worker-committee models. Although
this may be helpful in the short term, worker committees are not the solution to the
worker-empowerment issue in our opinion. Engaging in this runs the risk of promoting
‘parallel means’ to management as a way to avoid engagement with functioning
trade union movements. Worker committees do not have the power to collectively
bargain on anything aside from fringe benefits or minor wage increases, do not
have the right to take industrial action to back up their position, often can’t hold
independent elections, and are usually restricted to individual workplaces – meaning
members cannot take part in campaigning aimed at improving wages and conditions
on a sectoral, national or regional level. All in all, not so great for workers or long-
term change. A commitment or strategy to transition the work of BBW towards
collaboration with trade unions would be a good step.

Beyond the BBW programme, New Look is carrying out other work on freedom of
association and other factory projects, which is good. It has been doing some work
on short-term contracts (STCs) in North India, which sounds interesting. We hope
this learning will be used more widely in its Cambodian factories (where STCs are an
issue).

We are pleased also that New Look has started to use the Fair Wear Foundation
wage ladder to benchmark living wages in its supplier countries. Work in China
actually paying a living wage is also impressive. We hope that New Look will work
towards rolling this out more widely and seriously engaging in projects to meet these
figures. It seems to be on this path, which is positive. It is now vital that New Look
makes a real commitment to address pricing and internal calculation of costs to
ensure these living-wage levels can be paid.

                                What we say:
                                Next is taking a collaborative approach to the living-wage issue by working on improving
                                freedom of association (FOA) in Turkey. However, this long-term strategy still lacks living-
                                wage benchmarks and any commitment to address price, which is disappointing.



                                In more detail:
                                Has living-wage benchmarks?
                                No.

                                Worker empowerment:
                                Next says: “Our strategy to implement living wages has worker management dialogue as
                                a key / crucial pillar as the Turkey programme (see below) highlights. This collaboration
                                will allow us to build relationships with local suppliers and the global and local unions to
                                ensure capacity has been created to facilitate the scaling up of this work.”

                                Systematic training for workers and management in Turkey was detailed as part of Next’s
                                Joint Turkey Programme: “Trainings will be provided by Trade union and NGO partners at
                                all levels of the factory, moving into more focused work with management and workers
                                separately and together to identify shortfalls in the workplace against FOA requirements.”

                                Next has a well-used worker hotline complaints mechanism in China with the NGO Inno.

                                Commitment and practices:
                                Next uses the minimum wage as a benchmark on wages. No living-wage benchmark has

                            Company position on the living wage:

                            Conduct will be distributed to all our suppliers.”

                            Orsay has just added language about a living wage into its policy. This is a good first

In more detail:
Has living-wage benchmarks?
No.

Worker empowerment:
Orsay says: “It is the right of workers to set up or join workers’ organisations of
their choice (including unions) for collective bargaining.”

So far, no credible work has been done to check if this right is being upheld.

Commitment and practices:
Orsay has started to identify the gap between the minimum wage and living wage
by collecting minimum and maximum pay data as part of audits. It says it is able to
“compare now those incomes with the amount stated in AFW [Asia Floor Wage] in
order to define gaps and build a strategy to improve the situation.”

Collaborative approach:
Orsay is a member of the Ethical Trading Initiative.

Strategy:
Orsay says: “We are about to define a time scale and detailed strategy on how
implementing the living wage by 2015.” This is called the ‘Roadmap 2015’.

Production overview:
Number of suppliers: 155
Main production countries listed as: Turkey (16%), China (16%), Poland (16%),
India (12%), France (7%), Great Britain (6%), Tunisia (4%), Morocco (4%), Hong Kong (3%),
Bangladesh (2%)

Comments:
Orsay is at the very beginning of the road towards paying a living wage. Joining the
ETI and making a change in its code of conduct to include wording on a living wage is
a good start. Little else is as yet happening to make this a reality, but we hope that its
new Roadmap 2015 will help the company move forwards in a productive way. It would
be good for Orsay to link up with the work that smaller companies are doing on living-
wage projects, as part of the Fair Wear Foundation, and share ideas.

                            “Our Code states that living wages must be paid, that working hours must not be
                            excessive, and that overtime must be voluntary. Suppliers must comply with any
                            applicable laws and regulations, including those on minimum wages.”



                            What we say:
                            Pentland says in its code that “living wages must be paid” but in practice, as a company,
                            it only pays the minimum wage. We hope that mooted collaborative work on living wages
                            progresses soon.

                            Puma says: “PUMA is a signatory to the FOA (Freedom of Association) Protocol in

                            by suppliers to ensure that factory workers are free to form unions and organize.”

                            Puma displays posters on FOA in its supplier factories; a pocket guide is provided

                                Company position on the living wage:
                                We have looked at this company’s website and no information relating to sourcing or
                                labour standards policy was found. Replay later wrote to us and sent us its code of
                                conduct. On wages it says: “Employees must receive at least the legal minimum wage
                                for ordinary working hours as well as for overtime hours according to the standard labour
                                contract. Illegal or non authorized allowances in the wage packet are not permitted.”

                                Replay also says that it works with companies in Hong Kong and Tunisia to “ensure a
                                local presence in those countries where we are active, directly sourcing manufacurers
                                in these territories and conducting spot checks through-out the supply chain (be it for
                                simple components or finished garments). This gives Fashion Box greater transparency
                                and control over its production network and enables us to verify compliance with our
                                code of conduct.”



                                What we say:
                                Replay does not accept the principle of a living wage in its policy and is doing no work to
                                ensure that workers who make its products earn enough to live on. Simple compliance with
                                the minimum wage is a legal duty, but the human right to a living wage is a responsibility
                                that Replay must take steps to ensure. No evidence of this work is yet available.

                                business relationship with a supplier – we uphold this for all production countries.”

                                Switcher’s code of conduct says: “Wages and benefits paid for a standard working week
                                shall meet at least legal or industry minimum standards and always be sufficient to meet
                                basic needs of workers and their families and to provide some discretionary income.”



                                What we say:
                                Switcher is committed to paying a living wage and uses the Asia Floor Wage as a
                                benchmark. The company is collaborating with the Fair Wage Foundation (FWF) on ways
                                to implement payment of a living wage and has initiated a project in Bangladesh to raise
                                wages through creating a solidarity fund. Overall, Switcher has helped push forward the
                                international debate on a living wage and is working on this important topic throughout

                                Yes.

                                Worker empowerment:
                                Switcher includes statements on freedom of association in its code of conduct, as
                                stipulated in the FWF Code of Labour Practice, which is implemented in supplier
                                factories.

                                Switcher says it takes part in a ‘Workplace Education Programme’ as part of the
                                implementation of the FWF Code of Labour Practice. This has been jointly developed
                                with local trade unions and labour-rights NGOs. To date, only one Switcher supplier
                                from Turkey has participated in the training.

                                Switcher also uses the FWF’s grievance mechanism, whereby workers can report
                                problems in the factories with local persons of trust. Incoming complaints are handled
                                by the FWF and outcomes are made public in a report.

                             Takko is planning to start some interesting work to move towards payment of a living
                             wage, but hasn’t got there yet. It has been given credit for adopting living-wage

                             Takko says: “The Code of Labour practices and an information sheet for worker (in local

                             Takko uses the Fair Wage Foundation (FWF) complaints mechanism, which includes a
                             worker hotline for complaints and access to a suggestion box. Complaints are followed

                             although Takko says there are a growing number of complaints being submitted.

                            compensation packages comprised of wages and benefits that, at the very least, comply

                            What we say:
                            VF doesn’t recognise the principle of a living wage as part of its responsibility or policy.
