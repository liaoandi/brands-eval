YOUR GUIDE TO THE STORY
BEHIND THE BARCODE
What is the Ethical Fashion Guide?
This guide is a companion to the 2017 Ethical Fashion Report
and seeks to empower you to purchase from companies that
treat their workers ethically. By doing so, you encourage
more companies and decision makers to take action to
ensure workers are not exploited, they are paid adequately
and they work free from the tyranny of modern slavery.
You can view the full 2017 Ethical Fashion Report at www.
behindthebarcode.org.au

What do the grades mean?
This guide grades 330 brands and provides an overall grade
of each brand’s labour rights management systems. Higher
grades correspond to systems which, when implemented well,
should reduce the risk of modern slavery, child labour and
exploitation. Grades are derived from research undertaken
for the 2017 Ethical Fashion Report. You can download the
report for more information on the grading system.

How was the research conducted?
40 separate criteria were used to analyse each company’s
supply chain practices in four key areas:
  1. Polices
  2. Knowing Suppliers
  3. Auditing & Supplier Relationships
  4. Worker Voice
Companies were graded based on the evidence and input
they supplied in response to these criteria and pertinent
publicly available information.
*Companies marked as ‘non-responsive’ are those that chose not to disclose to
us the efforts they are taking to protect workers in their supply chain, so were
graded using publicly available information. More information can be found in
the full report.
