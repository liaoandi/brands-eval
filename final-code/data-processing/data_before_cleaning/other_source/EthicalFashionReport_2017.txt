Data evaluation
To verify the data provided by companies, we
review company responses and ask for clarification
and supporting documentation. In some instances,
we have relied on audit data provided to us by
companies to verify conditions and benefits that
workers receive.
Our research team and company representatives
work through the survey questions until both
parties are satisfied that the data presented is an
accurate representation of the company’s policies
and processes.
To ensure consistency in our assessment of
companies, after finalising company responses,
we cross-check survey responses. This means that
all data is reviewed at least three times by three
different people.

SALAHEYA’S STORY: Struggling
to support her family
Salaheya Khatun was a child bride and teen
mother who suffered brutal domestic violence
before she found a homeworker job stitching
quilts. But poverty led her to leave her family
and become a garment worker at a popular
UK retailer’s supplier in Dhaka.

Now in her mid-20s, Salaheya is working 72-hour
weeks and earning just 7000 Taka a month
(roughly AUD$113). That’s only about half of a
living wage!1
Sewing from 8am to 5pm, she then does three
hours of overtime before returning to her room
in a nearby slum, a tiny space she shares with two
other garment workers. Salaheya only sees her
daughter once every two to three months — her
parents care for the child, but they live in a village
six hours away.

PADMA BAI’S STORY:
Transforming her community
through Fairtrade
Padma Bai is challenging socio-cultural norms
with her agricultural leadership. A tribal Girijan
farmer, she was elected sarpanch (statutory
village head) of eight villages that are home to
more than 2,000 Fairtrade farmers. Padma Bai
herself cultivates cotton, red gram, black gram,
castor and soya on her three acres of family
land in Patelguda Village in the Telangana
province of India.

Policies
      This section evaluates the policies that companies have in
      place to address the risk of worker exploitation in supplier and
      subcontracted factories. It also checks their involvement in
      multi-stakeholder initiatives and their efforts to address their
      responsibility to manage the pressure placed on suppliers to fill
      orders. Most companies have now adopted policies which set
      the minimum working conditions they expect of their suppliers
      and factories. Policies are the first step to creating a robust
      supply chain management system.

Knowing Suppliers
      This section measures the degree to which a company has traced
      its suppliers at three key stages of production: cut-make-trim,
      inputs and raw materials. It also looks at how transparent the
      company is, with respect to the location and nature of its suppliers.

Auditing & Supplier
Relationships

        This section focuses on how a company manages its
        relationship with suppliers to ensure working conditions
        meet the standards set out in its policies. It evaluates
        audit processes as well as training and other industry
        collaboration efforts that continue to support factories to
        better understand and provide decent working conditions.
