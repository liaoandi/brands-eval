assess,Use of dog fur,Animals: Criticism,"According to investigations by Humane Society International (HSI) in 2011, fur vests sold by Wish were found to contain dog fur from China, despite being labelled 100% rabbit fur. Importation of dog or cat fur is illegal in Australia. Wish continued to sell the vests despite being advised of HSI's test results. Further investigations also found extremely high levels of toxic hexavalent chromium in a Wish fur vest.
