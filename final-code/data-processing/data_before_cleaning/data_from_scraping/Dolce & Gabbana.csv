assess,Sandblasting,Social: Criticism,"Sandblasting is a dangerous and deadly process which involves workers firing sand at jeans under high pressure. It has been known to kill workers within months as the inhalation of large amounts of silica dust generated during sandblasting causes silicosis, a potentially lethal pulmonary disease. Dolce & Gabbana continue to sell sandblasted denim clothing, even though a number of major brands, such as Levi's, Gucci and Versace have recently abolished sandblasted jeans in their collections and publicly supported a ban.

As a result, many companies have joined Greenpeace's Detox Program, which requires companies to adopt a credible, individual and public commitment to phase out the use and release of all toxic chemicals from their global supply chain and products, by 1 January 2020. This company is yet to make a commitment despite pressure from Greenpeace.
