assess,Workers Rights,Social: Criticism,"To lower its manufacturing costs, Giordano has outsourced their manufacturing to factories in mainland China. As a result, the workers at these factories are exploited and are forced to work in environments that are in violation of the law. At the five Giordano suppliers SACOM surveyed, working hours were the most serious violation of workers' rights. During peak seasons, workers work 13 hours a day, 7 days a week. These factories violate, for instance, the Chinese law requiring employers to guarantee workers 1 day of rest each week. Likewise, most factories also illegally withhold overtime wages.
